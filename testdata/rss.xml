Find out what's new and how to avoid breaking your podcast by using the added functionality wrong. Join Ray Ortega, +Daniel J. Lewis and +Todd Cochrane  to discuss Podcasts Connect, a new podcast dashboard for iTunes. Some of the new controls include: Refresh feed: updates iTunes with the newest information in your RSS feed. Use only when necessary. Abuse will probably lead to this feature being taken away. Hide Podcast: You can hide your podcast from being seen in the iTunes store. Delete Podcast: permanently remove your podcast from iTunes. Mirror URL: "A permanent link to your RSS Feed URL. Users subscribed to your podcast using the Mirror URL are redirected to your RSS Feed URL in Podcasts app and iTunes. This allows you to change your RSS Feed URL without losing users subscribed to your Mirror URL BUT for listeners subscribed directly to your feed URL, use a new-feed-URL tag or a server redirect." Change URL: This can be used to change your RSS feed address HOWEVER, for listeners subscribed directly to your feed URL, you will still need to use a new-feed-URL tag or a server redirect. In other words, do not make changes to this section unless you know what you are doing. This could lead to you losing your subscribers!

			<description><![CDATA[  Podcasting has been referred to as the wild, wild West of media because essentially podcasters can do, say, show anything they want on their podcasts. This is true, you can do whatever you want. But what happens when someone else doesn't like what you're doing? Can you get in trouble...with the law? Listen as lawyers +Gordon Firemark and +Greg Gronholm join me (+Ray Ortega), +Daniel J. Lewis and +David Jackson  to discuss the legalities of podcasting. We cover the biggest questions most commonly asked like, how much of someone else's music can I use in my podcast? Or can I play an audio clip from another media source? And how about names, trademarks, copyright, we'll cover that too. To view the chat archive which includes links, please visit the Event page for this Round.

Hopefully as our show grows over time we glean podcasting nuggets from other podcasters that make our show that much better. On this Round join me (+Ray Ortega), +Daniel J.

			<description><![CDATA[Recorded live on the show floor at New Media Expo 2014 (NMX), Ray, Daniel and Dave ask, Are Conferences Worth It? This is an audio only Round. See the player below. Attending a conference is rarely a cheap endeavor. You spend money on travel, lodging, food and of course tickets. Even if the conference is free and local, you invest time and energy. So, is it worth it? What do you get in return for your investment? On this Round, Ray Ortega, Daniel J. Lewis, David Jackson and a whole host of new Roundtablers, chosen from the audience (see below), discuss the value of attending a conference with special focus on the 2014 NMX show in Las Vegas. Special thanks to everyone who showed up to watch us record this Round, to Nick Seuberling for doing an awesome job managing the guest microphone and Megan Enloe from NMX for helping to make this happen. I've been told that NMX loved the Round and is excited to have us back on the live "stage" again next year. We hope to see you there! Returning Roundtablers making an appearance on this Round include: Nick Seuberling, Ibarionex Perello, Ben Adam-Smith, Corey Fineran New Roundtablers featured on this Round: Jeremy Chandanais (aka JC), Larissa Galenes, Vickie Velazquez, Shannon Hernandez, George Hrab, Craig Gilley, Amy Bowser-Rollins, Rob Cesternino, Tawny Fineran, and Charles McFall.  ]]></description>
